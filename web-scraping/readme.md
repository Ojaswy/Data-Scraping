#### We will be using Python's BeautifulSoup4 and Requests libraries for Web Scraping.

##### You can find various implementations of the same in the above witten codes:

1. spotify_album.py - *This script searches Spotify for albums matching a given search term.*

2. bbc_headlines.py - *This script finds all headlines on the BBC News homepage that match a given string.*

3. stackoverflow_search.py - *This script searches for a term on StackOverflow and shows the title of the first result.*

4. github_repo_count.py - *This script tells you how many public repositories you have on GitHub, and then uses your password to log in and                            find out how many repositories you have in total.*

5. postcode_to_latlng.py - *# This script uses the Google Maps Geocoding API to find the latitude and longitude of a given address.*
